            Tooth Powders and Mouth Washes

            Tooth powders, regarded as a means merely of cleansing the teeth, are most commonly placed among cosmetics;
            but
            this should not be, as they assist greatly in preserving a healthy and regular condition of the dental
            machinery, and so aid in perfecting as much as possible the act of mastication. In this manner, they may be
            considered as most useful, although it is true, subordinate medicinal agents. By a careful and prudent use
            of
            them, some of the most frequent causes of early loss of the teeth may be prevented; these are, the
            deposition of
            tartar, the swelling of the gums, and an undue acidity of the saliva. The effect resulting from accumulation
            of
            the tartar is well known to most persons, and it has been distinctly shown that swelling of the substance of
            the
            gums will hasten the expulsion of the teeth from their sockets; and the action of the saliva, if unduly
            acid, is
            known to be at least injurious, if not destructive.

            Now, the daily employment of a tooth powder sufficiently hard, so as to exert a tolerable degree of friction
            upon the teeth, without, at the same time, injuring the enamel of the teeth, will, in most cases, almost
            always
            prevent the tartar accumulating in such a degree as to cause subsequent injury to the teeth; and a flaccid,
            spongy, relaxed condition of the gums may be prevented or overcome by adding to such a tooth powder, some
            tonic
            and astringent ingredient. A tooth powder containing charcoal and cinchona bark, will accomplish these
            results
            in most cases, and therefore dentists generally recommend such. Still, there are objections to the use of
            charcoal; it is too hard and resisting, its color is objectionable, and it is perfectly insoluble by the
            saliva,
            it is apt to become lodged between the teeth, and there to collect decomposing animal and vegetable matter
            around such particles as may be fixed in this position. Cinchona bark, too, is often stringy, and has a
            bitter,
            disagreeable taste.


            Tooth Powders

            <article>
                Camphorated Chalk Powder

                Precipitated chalk, 1 lb.
                Powdered orris-root, 1/2 lb.
                Powdered camphor, 1/4 lb.

                Reduce the camphor to powder by rubbing it in a mortar with a little spirit, then sift the whole well
                together.
                On account of the volatility of camphor, the powder should always be sold in bottles, or at least in
                boxes
                lined
                with tinfoil.

            Otto of peppermint, 5 drops.

            All these tinctures should be made with grape spirit, or at least with pale unsweetened brandy.

            Rectified spirit, 1 quart.
            Rhatany root, 2 oz.
            Gum myrrh, 2 oz.
            Whole cloves, 2 oz.

            Macerate for fourteen days, and strain.

            Myrrh and Borax Wash

            Spirits of wine, 1 quart.
            Borax, 1 oz.
            Honey, 1 oz.
            Gum myrrh, 1 oz.
            Red sanders wood, 1 oz.

            Rub the honey and borax well together in a mortar, then gradually add the spirit, which should not be
            stronger
            than .920, i.e. proof spirit, the myrrh, and sanders wood, and macerate for fourteen days.
