            <h2>Tooth Powders and Mouth Washes</h2>

            <p>Tooth powders, regarded as a means merely of cleansing the teeth, are most commonly placed among
                cosmetics;
                but
                this should not be, as they assist greatly in preserving a healthy and regular condition of the dental
                machinery, and so aid in perfecting as much as possible the act of mastication. In this manner, they may
                be
                considered as most useful, although it is true, subordinate medicinal agents. By a careful and prudent
                use
                of
                them, some of the most frequent causes of early loss of the teeth may be prevented; these are, the
                deposition of
                tartar, the swelling of the gums, and an undue acidity of the saliva. The effect resulting from
                accumulation
                of
                the tartar is well known to most persons, and it has been distinctly shown that swelling of the
                substance of
                the
                gums will hasten the expulsion of the teeth from their sockets; and the action of the saliva, if unduly
                acid, is
                known to be at least injurious, if not destructive.
            </p>

            <p>Now, the daily employment of a tooth powder sufficiently hard, so as to exert a tolerable degree of
                friction
                upon the teeth, without, at the same time, injuring the enamel of the teeth, will, in most cases, almost
                always prevent the tartar accumulating in such a degree as to cause subsequent injury to the teeth; and
                a flaccid,
                spongy, relaxed condition of the gums may be prevented or overcome by adding to such a tooth powder,
                some
                tonic
                and astringent ingredient. A tooth powder containing charcoal and cinchona bark, will accomplish these
                results
                in most cases, and therefore dentists generally recommend such. Still, there are objections to the use
                of
                charcoal; it is too hard and resisting, its color is objectionable, and it is perfectly insoluble by the
                saliva,
                it is apt to become lodged between the teeth, and there to collect decomposing animal and vegetable
                matter
                around such particles as may be fixed in this position. Cinchona bark, too, is often stringy, and has a
                bitter,
                disagreeable taste.
